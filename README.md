<h2>## 📚 What I Learned</h2>

<P>This task helped me understand the full process of creating and deploying a static website. Here are the main things I learned:

1. - How to create and structure a basic `index.html` file.
- Writing clean and simple HTML using tags like `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`.
- Styling a webpage using both internal and external CSS.
- Initializing a Git repository and pushing code to GitHub.
- Enabling GitHub Pages to host static sites directly from a repo.
- Viewing a live website from a custom GitHub Pages link.
- Understanding a basic developer workflow — from local file creation to live deployment.

<h3>## 🐾 About the TinDog Project</h3>

<p>TinDog is a mock landing page inspired by the idea of "Tinder for Dogs." It’s a beginner-friendly web development project that helped me practice:

- Building a responsive layout
- Organizing content into sections (hero, features, testimonials, etc.)
- Applying consistent styling across a simple static site
- Using CSS to add fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment
